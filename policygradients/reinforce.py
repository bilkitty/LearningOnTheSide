# Neural Network Setup
# The architecture of this network is the following:
#    a 1 layer network (remember that we don't include the output layer in the count)
#    Data enters a fully connected input layer passes through relu activation. A second fully
#    connected layer takes its outputs and passes through softmax activation to yield probabilities
#    for multiple actions.
# We use Adam (or Adaptive Moments Estimation) optimization because it is memory efficient and requires
# little tuning.
